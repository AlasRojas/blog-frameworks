      "description": "Having a Javascript foundation makes it easier to learn the basic concepts of each framework. Each framework has its own syntax and structures, but based on these similarities you can make translations between them without losing their internal logic. For example, if you have a function in React, you can translate it to Vue or Angular without losing its functionality. This allows you to take advantage of each framework's benefits and use the one that best fits your project."
